# Final Project – System Analysis & Design-2

## Overview
This folder contains the **Final Project** developed for the *System Analysis & Design-2* course.  
The project represents a complete practical application of the concepts studied during the semester, combining **analysis, design, implementation, and testing** in one integrated system.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to analyze system requirements, design structured solutions, and implement them using Object-Oriented Programming principles and proper software design practices.

---

## Project Description
The final project focuses on building a **software-based system** that applies the theoretical concepts of System Analysis & Design in a practical and structured manner.

The project includes:
- Requirement understanding and system analysis
- UML and design representations
- Object-Oriented implementation
- Testing and validation
- Documentation and reflection

All work was implemented according to the academic requirements of the course.

---

## Applied Concepts
Throughout the project, the following concepts were applied:

- System Analysis & Design fundamentals
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- SOLID principles where applicable
- Design patterns applied
- Manual testing and validation techniques
---

## Project Structure
This folder contains all required materials for the final project, including:

- **TaskDescription.md**  
  Describes the final project requirements and objectives.

- **Solution.md**  
  Explains the implemented solution and how the project was designed and structured.

- **Reflection.md**  
  Provides personal reflection covering:
  - What was learned
  - Challenges faced
  - Improvements compared to previous tasks

- **Manual Test Cases (.xlsx)**  
  Contains documented manual test cases used to validate the system.

- **Source Code Folder**
